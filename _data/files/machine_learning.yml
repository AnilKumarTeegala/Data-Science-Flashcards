  question: What is the difference between data science and machine learning
  answer: >
    Data science = statistical analysis + data engineering in order to get 
    information from the data
    <br><br>
    Machine learning = create a model to predict something. You can also define 
    it as teaching computers to learn by examples

- question: What is Naive Bayes?
  answer: >
    Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes theorem that is used
    to solve classification problems.

- question: Why is Naive Bayes called "naive"?
  answer: >
    Because the Naive Bayes is based on the idea that the predictor variables are independent of 
    each other while in nature this is oft not the case.

- question: What is the Bayes theorem?
  answer: >
    The Bayes theorem is a mathematical formula for finding P(A|B) from P(B|A).
    The formula is 
    <br><br>
    P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)


- question: What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?
  answer: >
    The Naive Bayes is a relatively simple and very quick algorithm since it is a probabilistic 
    model that does not require a training step. This makes it very scalable.

- question: When is the Naive Bayes usually used?
  answer: > 
    Naive Bayes is often used in <br>
    - text classification like spam filter<br>
    - real-time classification since it is fast<br>
    - multi-class prediction

- question: When Naive Bayes is used with numerical variables, what condition is assumed on the data?
  answer: >
    Numerical variables used in Naive Bayes are expected to have a normal distribution.
    This is not always the case in practice.

- question: How does the Naive Bayes perform with categorical variables?
  answer: > 
    It performs well with categorical variables since no assumpion is made on
    the data distribution. By contrast with numerical variables a normal distribution
    is assumed.
