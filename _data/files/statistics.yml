  question: What are the three main types of data you can encounter?
  answer: >
    The three main types of data types are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>numerical data</b>: the data represents some kind of quantitative value that you can measure. It could be a temperature or a weight. 
    Numerical data can be divided into 
    <ul>
      <li><i>discrete data</i>: it is integer based and can assume a limited set of values, for example like the amount of money you have on your account.</li> 
      <li><i>continuous data</i>: it has an infinite number of possible values like the weight of a person, which can be 60 Kg or 60,345 Kg or 60,345678 Kg. In this
      example you can take the weight with as many decimals as you like.</li> 
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>categorical data:</b> it is data that can have numerical values but those numbers have no intrinsic mathematical meaning. Some examples are gender, race, religion. 
    You can maps values to number, like say male is 0 and female is 1. But those number have no mathematical meaning, i.e. the male value has no
    numerical relationship with the female value.</li>
    <li><b>ordinal data:</b> this is a mixture of numerical and categorical data. More specifically it is categorical data with mathematical
    meaning. For example the hotel rating stars from 1 to 5 have a numerical meaning: a five star hotel
    is better than a two star hotel.</li>

- question: What is a random variable?
  answer: > 
    A random variable assigns a numeric value to each possile outcome of a random phenomenon. 
    A numeric value is a necessary condition in 
    the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. 
 
- question: What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables? Can you make a couple of examples of both?
  answer: >
    <b>Discrete random variables</b> have a finite number of possible 
    outcomes. An example of discrete random variables is the result of tossing a coin. 
    There are two possible outcomes (head or tail).   
    <br><br>
    <b>Continuous random variables</b> have a non-finite number of possible outcomes. In other words a continuous random
    variable can assume any value in an interval. An example of continuous random variable
    is the temperature in a room. The temperature can take any value within a range.

- question: What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A, that is indicated by P(A)?
  answer: P(A) = num cases for event A / num all cases

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: A’ is the event that A does not happen and its probability is given by <br>P(A') = 1-P(A)

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    Two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint when only one of the two events can occur.

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously.

- question: What is the meaning of the probability P(A &cup; B)? What is the formula for the probability P(A &cup; B)? 
  answer: >
    P(A &cup; B) is the probability that either event A or event B happens. 
    <br><br>
    P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &cap; B)

- question: > 
    If  events A and B are disjoint, what is the formula for the probability 
    P(A &cup; B)
  answer: P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B)

- question: What does it mean that two events are independent?
  answer: >
    Two independent events are two events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br>
    P(A|B) = P(A)
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both events happen?
  answer: P(A &cap; B) = P(A) x P(B)

- question: >
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing probabilities? Can you use it
    to visualize P(A), P(A'), P(A &cup; B), P(A &cap; B)? 
  answer: The Venn diagram is very useful for visualizing probabilities.

- question: What is the meaning of conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: >
    The conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability that A happens
    given that event B has already happened.

- question: > 
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing conditional probabilities? Can you use
    this diagram to visualize the conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: Conditional probabilities can be well visualized with a <b>probability tree</b>.

- question: What is the law of total probability?
  answer: > 
    P(B) = P(B &cap; A) + P(B &cap; A’) = 
    <br>
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution is a plot that displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the expectation of a probability distribution? Can you calculate it with an example?
  answer: >
    The expectation E(X) of a probability distribution X is basically the average value of the
    probability distribution. It is defined as
    <br><br>
    E(X) = sum x * P(X = x)
    <br><br>
    For example given x = 1,2,3 and P(x) = 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 we have that E(X) equals 
    1*0.2 + 2*0.5 + 3*0.3 = 2.1

- question: What is an uniform distribution? Draw a plot of it.
  answer: An uniform distribution is a distribution where all values have the same probability.

- question: What types of discrete probability distributions are there?
  answer: >
     There are the Bernoulli distribution, the Binomial distribution and
     the Poisson distribution.
     <br><br>
     The <b>Bernoulli distribution</b> is a random experiment that has 2 possible
     outcomes with probability p and q, where p+q = 1
     <br><br>
     The <b>Binomial distribution</b> is a sequence of repeated Bernoulli trials
     performed indipendently. 
     <br>
     n = number of items, k = num items I pickup
     <br> All possible combinations are n! / ( (n-k)! * k! )
     <br><br>
     The <b>Poisson distribution</b> is a limiting version of the Binomial distribution
     where the number of trials n gets really large but the probability of success p
     gets smaller at the same time. In other words if you have a Binomial distribution
     where you let n tends to infinite and p tends to zero such that np = &lambda;, then
     that distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter &lambda;.


- question: What is the normal distribution?
  answer: >
    The normal distribution is a density distribution where the data is distributed 
    around a central value in the form of a bell-shaped curve. Random variables 
    have a normal distribution.

- question: What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is it important?
  answer: >
    The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution 
    of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger.
    <br><br>
    The Central Limit Theorem is important because under certain conditions you can 
    approximate a non-normal distribution with a normal distribution.


- question: What is the difference between mean, median, mode?
  answer: >
    Mean = sum all items / num items
    <br><br>Median =  value in the middle when the values are sorted
    <br><br>Mode = most frequent value in a dataset
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,4,2006 we have 
    <br>Mean = (1+3+4+4+2006) / 5
    <br>Median = 4
    <br>Mode = 4

- question: When is the mean more useful and when the median is more useful?
  answer: >
    The mean is more useful when there are no outliers.
    <br>The median is more useful when there are outliers.

- question: >
    What does it mean when the median and the mean have the same value or different values?
  answer: >
    If the distribution is a normal distribution then the mean and variance are equals.
    However, when the mean and variance are equal, this does not mean the distribution is normal.    
    <br><br>If mean > median, the distribution is skewed to the right, ie the tail is on the right.
    <br><br>If mean < median, the distribution is skewed to the left, ie the tail is on the left.

- question: >
    What quantities can you use to measure variability and spread?
  answer: >
    You can use the following quantities: range, interquartile range, 
    variance and standard deviation.

- question: What is the range?
  answer: Range is the difference max -  min

- question: What is the interquartile range?
  answer: >
    The interquartile range is found as follows:
    <br>Divide the interval into 4 equal parts Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. 
    <br>The interquartile range is then IQR = Q3 - Q1
