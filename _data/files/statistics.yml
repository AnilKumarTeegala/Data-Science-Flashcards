  question: What is a random variable?
  answer: > 
    A random variable assigna a numeric value to each possile outcome. 
    A numeric value is a necessary condition in 
    the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. 
    Notice that values of random variables are determined by chance.

- question: Can you explain the two types of random variable discrete and continuous?
  answer: >
    Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible 
    outcomes
    <br><br>
    Continuous random variables have a non-finite number of possible outcomes

- question: What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A, that is indicated by P(A)?
  answer: P(A) = num cases for event A / num all cases

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: A’ is the event that A does not happen and is given by 1-P(A)

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    It means that only one of them can occur

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously

- question: What is the probability P(A or B)?
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

- question: > 
    If  events A  and B are disjoint, what is the probability of either event 
    (A or B)
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

- question: What does it mean that 2 events are independent?
  answer: >
    These are 2 events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br>
    P(A|B) = P(A)
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both events happen?
  answer: P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

- question: >
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing probabilities? Can you use it
    to visualize P(A), P(A'), P(A or B), P(A and B)? 
  answer: The Venn diagram is very useful for visualizing probabilities.

- question: What is the meaning of conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: >
    The conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability that A happens
    given that event B has already happened.

- question: > 
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing conditional probabilities? Can you use
    this diagram to visualize the conditional property P(A|B)?
  answer: Conditional probabilities can be well visualized with a probability tree.

- question: What is the law of total probability?
  answer: > 
    P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A’) = 
    <br>
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the expectation of a probability distribution? Can you calculate it with an example?
  answer: >
    The expectation E(X) of a probability distribution X is basically the average value of the
    probability distribution. It is defined as
    <br><br>
    E(X) = sum x * P(X = x)
    <br><br>
    For example given x = 1,2,3 and P(x) = 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 we have that E(X) equals 
    1*0.2 + 2*0.5 + 3*0.3 = 2.1

- question: What is an uniform distribution? Draw a plot of it.
  answer: An uniform distribution is a distribution where all values are equally likely.

- question: What types of discrete probability distributions are there?
  answer: >
     There are the Bernoulli distribution, the Binomial distribution and
     the Poisson distribution.
     <br><br>
     The Bernoulli distribution is a random experiment that has 2 possible
     outcomes with probability p and q, where p+q = 1
     <br><br>
     The Binomial distribution is a sequence of repeated Bernoulli trials
     performed indipendently. 
     <br>
     n = number of items, k = num items I pickup
     <br> All possible combinations are n! / ( (n-k)! * k! )
     <br><br>
     The Poisson distribution is a limiting version of the Binomial distribution
     where the number of trials n gets really large but the probability of success p
     gets smaller at the same time. In other words if you have a Binomial distribution
     where you let n tends to infinite and p tends to zero such that np = &lambda;, then
     that distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter &lambda;.


- question: What is the normal distribution?
  answer: >
    The normal distribution is a density distribution where the data is distributed 
    around a central value in the form of a bell-shaped curve. Random variables 
    have a normal distribution.

- question: What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why it's important?
  answer: >
    The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution 
    of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger 
    The central limit theorem is important because under certain condition, you can 
    approximate some distribution with Normal distribution although the distribution is 
    not Normally distributed.


- question: What is the difference between mean, median, mode?
  answer: >
    Mean = sum all items / num items
    <br>Median =  value in the middle when the values are sorted
    <br>Mode = most frequent value in a dataset
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,9,2006 we have 
    <br>Mean = (1+3+4+9+2006) / 5
    <br>Median = 4

- question: When is the mean more useful and when the median is more useful?
  answer: >
    The mean is more useful when there are no outliers.
    <br>The median is more useful when there are outliers.

- question: >
    When the median and the mean have the same value or different values, what does it mean?
  answer: >
    If the distribution is a normal distribution then the mean and variance are equals.
    However, when the mean and variance are equal, this does not mean the distribution is normal.    
    <br><br>If mean > median, the distribution is skewed to the right, ie the tail is on the right.
    <br><br>If mean < median, the distribution is skewed to the left, ie the tail is on the left.

- question: >
    What quantities can you use to measure variability and spread?
  answer: >
    You can use the following quantities: range, interquartile range, 
    variance and standard deviation.

- question: What is the range?
  answer: Range is the difference max -  min

- question: What is the interquartile range?
  answer: >
    The interquartile range is found as follows:
    <br>Divide the interval into 4 equal parts Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. 
    <br>The interquartile range is then IQR = Q3 - Q1
