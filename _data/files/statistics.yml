  h3: Types of data
  question: What are the three main types of data you can encounter?
  answer: >
    The three main types of data types are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>numerical data</b>: the data represents some kind of quantitative value that you can measure. It could be a temperature or a weight. 
    Numerical data can be divided into 
    <ul>
      <li><i>discrete data</i>: it is integer based and can take a limited set of values, for example like the amount of money you have on your account.</li> 
      <li><i>continuous data</i>: it has an infinite number of possible values like the weight of a person, which can be 60 Kg or 60,345 Kg or 60,345678 Kg. In this
      example you can take the weight with as many decimals as you like.</li> 
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>categorical data:</b> it is data that can have numerical values but those numbers have no intrinsic mathematical meaning. Some examples are gender, race, religion. 
    You can maps values to number, like say male is 0 and female is 1. But those number have no mathematical meaning, i.e. the male value has no
    numerical relationship with the female value.</li>
    <li><b>ordinal data:</b> this is a mixture of numerical and categorical data. More specifically it is categorical data with mathematical
    meaning. For example the hotel rating stars from 1 to 5 have a numerical meaning: a five star hotel
    is better than a two star hotel.</li>

- question: What is a random variable?
  answer: > 
    A random variable assigns a numeric value to each possile outcome of a random phenomenon. 
    A numeric value is a necessary condition in 
    the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. 
 
- question: What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables? Can you make a couple of examples of both?
  answer: >
    <b>Discrete random variables</b> have a finite number of possible 
    outcomes. An example of discrete random variables is the result of tossing a coin. 
    There are two possible outcomes (head or tail).   
    <br><br>
    <b>Continuous random variables</b> have a non-finite number of possible outcomes. In other words a continuous random
    variable can assume any value in an interval. An example of continuous random variable
    is the temperature in a room. The temperature can take any value within a range.

- h3: Probabilities
  question: >
    What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A, that is indicated by P(A)? 
    What are the maximum and minimum values of P(A)?
  answer: >
    The <b>probability</b> of occurence of event A is indicated by P(A) and is given by the number of ways that event A can happen divided by
    the number of all possible outcomes.
    <br><br>For example when you toss a coin, the probability of getting head is given by the number of ways you can get
    head (1 actually) divided by all possible outcomes (possible outcomes are 2: hear or tail), i.e. the probability of
    getting head is equal to 1 / 2.
    <br><br>In mathematical terms we have <b>P(A) = num cases for event A / num all cases</b>
    <br><br>
    P(A) is a value between 0 (event not happening) and 1 (event happening for sure).

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: >
    P(A’) is the <b>complementary event</b> of A, i.e. it is the event that event A does not happen. 
    The complementary event is given by 
    <br>P(A') = 1-P(A)

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    Two events are <b>mutually exclusive</b> or disjoint when only one of the two events can occur.

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously.

- question: What is the meaning of the probability P(A &cup; B)? What is the formula for the probability P(A &cup; B)? 
  answer: >
    P(A &cup; B) is the probability that either event A or event B happens. 
    <br><br>
    P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &cap; B)

- question: > 
    If  events A and B are disjoint, what is the formula for the probability 
    P(A &cup; B)
  answer: P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B)

- question: What does it mean that two events are independent?
  answer: >
    Two independent events are two events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br>
    P(A|B) = P(A)
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both events happen?
  answer: P(A &cap; B) = P(A) x P(B)

- question: >
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing probabilities? Can you use it
    to visualize P(A), P(A'), P(A &cup; B), P(A &cap; B)? 
  answer: >
    The <b>Venn diagram</b> is very useful for visualizing probabilities. The Venn diagram is
    a diagram where the space of all possible outcomes is represented by a rectangle and events are 
    represented by circles. <br><br>
    In the following images you can see the following probabilities represented with the Venn diagram:
    <ul>
    <li>P(A) = probability of event A happening</li>
    <li>P(A') = probability of event A' happening, i.e. probability of event A <u>not</u> happening</li>
    <li>P(A &cup; B) = probability of event A <u>or</u> event B happening</li>
    <li>P(A &cap; B) = probability of events A <u>and</u> B happening</li>
    </ul>

- question: What is the meaning of conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: >
    The conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability that A happens
    given that event B has already happened.

- question: > 
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing conditional probabilities? Can you use
    this diagram to visualize the conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: Conditional probabilities can be well visualized with a <b>probability tree</b>.
  image: conditional_tree.png

- question: What is the law of total probability?
  answer: > 
    P(B) = P(B &cap; A) + P(B &cap; A’) = 
    <br>
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution is a plot that displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the expectation of a probability distribution? Can you calculate it with an example?
  answer: >
    The expectation E(X) of a probability distribution X is basically the average value of the
    probability distribution. It is defined as
    <br><br>
    E(X) = sum x * P(X = x)
    <br><br>
    For example given x = 1,2,3 and P(x) = 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 we have that E(X) equals 
    1*0.2 + 2*0.5 + 3*0.3 = 2.1

- question: What is an uniform distribution? Draw a plot of it.
  answer: An uniform distribution is a distribution where all values have the same probability.
  image: uniform_distribution.PNG

- question: What types of discrete probability distributions are there?
  answer: >
     There are the Bernoulli distribution, the Binomial distribution and
     the Poisson distribution.
     <br><br>
     The <b>Bernoulli distribution</b> is a random experiment that has 2 possible
     outcomes with probability p and q, where p+q = 1
     <br><br>
     The <b>Binomial distribution</b> is a sequence of repeated Bernoulli trials
     performed indipendently. 
     <br>
     n = number of items, k = num items I pickup
     <br> All possible combinations are n! / ( (n-k)! * k! )
     <br><br>
     The <b>Poisson distribution</b> is a limiting version of the Binomial distribution
     where the number of trials n gets really large but the probability of success p
     gets smaller at the same time. In other words if you have a Binomial distribution
     where you let n tends to infinite and p tends to zero such that np = &lambda;, then
     that distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter &lambda;.


- question: What is the normal distribution?
  answer: >
    The normal distribution is a density distribution where the data is distributed 
    around a central value in the form of a bell-shaped curve. Random variables 
    have a normal distribution.

- question: What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is it important?
  answer: >
    The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution 
    of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger.
    <br><br>
    The Central Limit Theorem is important because under certain conditions you can 
    approximate a non-normal distribution with a normal distribution.


- h3: Averages
  question: What is the meaning of average of the data?
  answer: You can think of the average as the center of the data.

  question: There are three different sorts of average&#58; mean, median, mode. How do they differ?
  answer: >    
    <b>Mean</b> (&mu;) = <div class="frac">
          <span>sum all items</span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">number of items</span>
          </div>
    <br><br><b>Median</b> =  value in the middle when the values are sorted. When the number of items is even there is no a single middle
    value and the mean of the two middle numbers is taken instead.
    <br><br><b>Mode</b> = most frequent value in a dataset
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,4,2006 we have 
    <br>Mean = (1+3+4+4+2006) / 5
    <br>Median = 4
    <br>Mode = 4
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,5,6,8  we have 6 numbers. The median is given by the mean of the two middle values i.e. (4+5)/2


- question: When is the mean more useful and when the median is more useful?
  answer: >
    The <b>mean</b> is more useful when there are no outliers. Indeed the mean is more affected
    by outliers than the median. The mean tends to move in the directions of the outliers.
    <br><br>The <b>median</b> is more useful when there are outliers.
    <br><br>In other words, the mean 
    is more representative when the data distribution is normal while the median is more representative when 
    the data distribution is skewed.

- question: >
    What does it mean when the median and the mean have the same value or different values?
  answer: >
    If the distribution is a normal distribution then the mean and variance are equals.
    However, when the mean and variance are equal, this does not mean the distribution is normal.    
    <br><br>If mean > median, the distribution is skewed to the right, i.e. the tail is on the right.
    <br><br>If mean < median, the distribution is skewed to the left, i.e. the tail is on the left.
  image: mean_median_skewed.png

- question: Can you use the mean/median with categorical data?
  answer:  >
    No, it is not possible to use the mean/median with categorical data. Mean/median can be used only
    with numerical data. The average that you can use with categorical data is the mode.

- question: When is the mode useful as an average quantity? 
  answer: >
    The <b>mode</b> is the most frequent value in a dataset. The mode is useful as an average quantity when
    <ul>
    <li>the data is <i>categorical</i>. Indeed in this case the mode is the only average that can be used since the mean and median
    are used with numerical data.</li>
    <li>the data is <i>numerical or categorical</i> and there are two or more <i>clusters</i>. In that case it is more representive to take
    the node of each cluster. 
    <br><br>For example if you have the numbers <code>(2,2,3,3,3,4,4,40,40,41,41,41,42,42)</code>, 
    we have two clusters. The more representative average values are then the modes 3 (mode of first cluster) and 41 (mode of second cluster).</li>
    </ul>
- h3: Variability and Spread
  question: >
    What quantities can you use to measure variability and spread?
  answer: >
    You can use the following quantities: range, interquartile range, 
    variance and standard deviation.

- question: What is the range?
  answer: >
    The <b>range</b> is given by the difference between the largest and the smallest values in a dataset.
    The range is one of the ways of measuring how much a dataset is spread out.

- question: What are some advantages / disadvantages of the range?
  answer: >
    The <b>range</b> has the <i>advantage</i> that is pretty simple and thus easy to understand.
    <br><br>
    The <i>disadvantages</i> of the range are that it does not provide information about the data within the range
    and it is heavily affected by outliers. Indeed outliers are always at the border of the dataset. 

- question: What is the interquartile range?
  answer: >
    The <b>interquartile range (IQR)</b> is another way of measung how spread a data is. The idea is to provide a value
    that is less affected by outliers than it is the range. In simple terms the interquartile range can be thought of
    as a mini range around the center of the data.
    <br><br>
    The <b>interquartile range</b> can be found as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>sort the data.</li>
    <li>Find 3 values <code>Q1, Q2, Q3</code> that split your dataset into four equal parts. <code>Q1, Q2, Q3</code> are called <i>quartiles</i>.</li> 
    <li>The interquartile range is then given by <code>IQR = Q3 - Q1</code>. 
    <br><code>Q3</code> is called <i>upper quartile</i>, 
    <code>Q1</code> is called <i>lower quartile</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Notice that we take the quartiles around the center of the data. In this way outliers are excluded automatically from the computation
    of IQR.
- question: >
    When you compute the interquartile range, you have to find the so-called quartiles, points that divide the dataset 
    into four equal parts. The middle quartile is equal to a certain type of average. What average is that?
  answer: The <b>middle quartile</b> is equal to the median.

- question: What is the variance? What is its main disadvantage?
  answer: > 
    The <b>variance</b> is a way of measuring how the data is spread. The variance is defined as the average of the 
    squared distance of all points from the mean.
    <br>
    <b> Variance&nbsp; = &nbsp;<div class="frac">
          <span>&Sigma; (x - &mu;)<sup>2</sup></span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">n</span>
          </div>
          &nbsp; = &nbsp; <div class="frac">
          <span>&Sigma; x<sup>2</sup></span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">n</span>
          </div>&nbsp; - &nbsp; &mu;<sup>2</sup>
        </b>

    <br>where  &mu; = mean,    n = number of points
    <br><br>The main <i>disadvantage</i> of the variance is that it describes the data spread using squared distances,
     and this is less intuitive.
- question: What is the standard deviation?
  answer: >
    The <b>standard deviation</b> &rho; describes how spread the data is. It is actually the squared value of the <i>variance</i>.
    In this way the main weak point of the variance (the fact of using squared distances) is compensated.
    <br><br>
    &rho; = <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">
            &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-size:17px">variance</span>
            </span> 

    <br><br>A <u>small</u> standard deviation means that most of the points are close to the mean value. 
    A <u>high</u> standard deviation means the points are spread out and far away from the mean. 

- question: What is the minimum value of the standard deviation?
  answer: The smallest value of the standard deviation is 0. This happens when all data points are equal.

- question: What are standard scores? What is the main idea behind?
  answer: >
    <b>Standard scores</b> (denoted by z) are numerical quantities that allow you to compare data distributions with different
    means and variances. In mathematical terms we have
    <br>
    <b> z &nbsp; = &nbsp;<div class="frac">
          <span>x - &mu;</span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">&rho;</span>
          </div>
    </b>
    <br> where &mu; = mean, &rho; = standard deviation.
    <br><br>
    The <b>main idea</b> behind standard scores is that the data distributions to compare are transformed into a new theoretical data 
    distribution with &mu; = 0 and &rho; = 1. This makes the comparison possible.
