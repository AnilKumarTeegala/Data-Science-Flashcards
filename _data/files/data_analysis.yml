  question: What is the hamming distance?
  answer: >
    The hamming distance is used for categorical features. If all the variables 
    are categorical then the hamming distance is defined as the number of mismatches

- question: What is the Manhattan (or city block) distance?
  answer: >
    It is the number of horizontal and/or vertical steps to go from point p1 to point 
    p2

- question: What is the distance matrix?
  answer: >
    It is a square matrix (two-dimensional array) containing the distances, taken 
    pairwise, between the elements of a set of points

- question: What is the Levenshtein distance?
  answer: >
    The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits 
    (insertions, deletions or substitutions) to change one word into one another

- question: What is the Z-score normalization (also called standardization)?
  answer: > 
    It is a technique that scales the values so that they will have the properties
    of a standard distribution with mean &mu; = 0  and standard deviation &sigma; = 1.
    <br>The formula for the normalization is z = (x - &mu;) / &sigma;


- question: What is the min-max scaling (also called normalization)?
  answer: >
    It is a technique that scales the values between 0 and 1. 
    <br>The formula for the min max scaling is 
    <br>scaled = (toscale - min) / (max - min)

- question: When is Z-score normalization used? When is min-max scaling used instead?
  answer: >
    The Z-score normalization is used when the data has a gaussian distribution.
    <br><br>
    The min-max scaling is more used when the distribution is not gaussian or not known.
    In addition, the min-max scaling works better than the Z-normalization when the 
    standard deviation is very small. Indeed in such case the effect of scaling the data
    between 0 and 1 will not affect the standard deviation significantly since it 
    is already small.

- question: >
    What is the disadvantage of min-max scaling compared to Z-score normalization 
    concerning outliers?
  answer: >
    The min-max scaling is more sensitive to outliers since the data is
    bounded between 0 and 1 which automatically leads to information loss about
    outliers. 
    <br>
    The Z-score normalization is more suited when there are outliers since the
    data is not bounded but simply rescaled to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

- question: How to treat missing values?
  answer: >
    There are several possible approaches<br>
    a) remove items with missing values<br>
    b) replace the missing value

- question: When is it reasonably possible to drop items with missing values?
  answer: When the items to remove are few compared to the size of the training set 

- question: What are the common techniques for replacing missing values?
  answer: >
    when values are missing randomly you can:<br>
    a) replace the missing values with the mean<br>
    b) interpolate values<br>
    c) take the previous or next value
- question: Can you draw a boxplot and explain it?
  answer: >
    Upper extreme (95th Percentile) = exactly 5 percent of the values in the data are 
    greater than this value. (May instead be the highest value if not displayed separately as dots).<br>
    Lower extreme (5th Percentile) = exactly 5 percent of the values in the data are less than this value. 
    (May instead be the smallest value if not displayed separately as dots).

- question:  What is a bar chart? What is the difference with an histogram?
  answer: >
    A bar chart records the frequency of every value of a categorical variable. It 
    is the same as an histogram except the histogram is for a continuous variable
- question: How to find outliers?
  answer: >
    You can use an histogram, a scatter plot or also some statistics values like to say that 
    outliers are outside of the 1.5 IQR limit
