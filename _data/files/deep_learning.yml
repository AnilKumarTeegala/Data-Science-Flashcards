  question: What is Deep Learning? Why is it called deep?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep Learning</b> is a subdomain of machine learning that makes use of artificial
    neural networks to learn from complex data structures like images and sounds. 
    <br><br>
    Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing structures that try to emulate the 
    human brain. ANN basic blocks are called neurons. A neuron can be thought of as
    a function that has a number of weighted inputs and computes an output. These neurons are 
    organized in layers and a simple form of ANN has an input layout, a middle layer and
    an output layer. All layers between the input layer and the output layer are called
    <i>hidden layers</i>. An ANN with one of two hidden layers is called a 
    <i>shallow neural network</i>. 
    <br><br>Deep Learning neural networks have many hidden layers. The word <b>deep</b> refers
    to this fact.

- question: What kind of neural networks works particularly well with image data?
  answer: >
    <b>Convolutional neural networks</b> are a kind of neural network that works
    particularly well with image data.
    <br><br>
    The basic idea behind convolutional neural networks is to 
    divide the input image into small fragments and apply a number of filters on 
    each fragment. Applying a filter is equivalent to searching for a pattern in the fragment.
    Each filter has a specific task, like searching for edges or for circles. 
    <br><br>
    In this way convolutional neural networks can better deal with images that are not very similar,
    for example because the images are rotated differently.

- question: What kind of neural network is particulary good at processing text data?
  answer: >
    A kind neural network that is particulary good at processing text data is 
    <b>recurrent neural networks</b>.
    <br><br>
    A recurrent neural network has an intern loop, that means the data is not processed all at once 
    but rather it is processed in different steps. In particular in the case of text, each word is 
    processed once at a time. This process is similar to the way humans read text.
