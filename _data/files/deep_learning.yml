  question: What is Deep Learning? Why is it called deep?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep Learning</b> is a subdomain of machine learning that makes use of artificial
    neural networks to learn from complex data structures like images and sounds. 
    <br><br>
    Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing structures that try to emulate the 
    human brain. ANN basic blocks are called neurons. A neuron can be thought of as
    a function that has a number of weighted inputs and computes an output. These neurons are 
    organized in layers and a simple form of ANN has an input layout, a middle layer and
    an output layer. All layers between the input layer and the output layer are called
    <i>hidden layers</i>. An ANN with one of two hidden layers is called a 
    <i>shallow neural network</i>. 
    <br><br>Deep Learning neural networks have many hidden layers. The word <b>deep</b> refers
    to this fact.

- question: What are the differences between machine learning and deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep learning</b> is a subset of <b>machine learning</b>. Both machine learning
    and deep learning try to create a mathematical model of a dataset. This mathematical
    model can then be used to make predictions on new input data. However these technologies
    differ in some points:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Techniques used</b>: machine learning can use several different techniques to create a mathematical model, 
    like regression, neural networks, nearest neighbors and decision trees.  By contrast, deep learning is
    based only on neural networks. These neural networks have a large number of hidden layers, which is what the 
    word <i>deep</i> refers to.</li>
    <li><b>quantity of data</b>: while machine learning algorithms can also work with small datasets, deep learning requires
    very large datasets.</li>
    <li><b>Feature selection</b>: in machine learning, the user selects the most important features or creates new ones 
    for the task at hand. By contrast, in deep learning the feature selection is done automatically by the algorithms during
    the training process.</li>
    </ul>

- question: What are Artificial Neural Networks?
  answer: >
    Artificial Neural networks are a specific set of algorithms that have revolutionized machine learning. They
    are inspired by biological neural networks. Neural Networks can adapt to changing the input, so the
    network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

- question: How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?
  answer: >
    There are two methods here:
    <ul>
      <li>Initialize the weights to zero</li> 
      <li>Assign them randomly.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <b>Initializing all weights to 0:</b> This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every
    layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Initializing all weights randomly:</b> Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close
    to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the
    most commonly used method.

- question: What Is the Cost Function?
  answer: >
    Also referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s
    performance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that
    error backwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.

- question: What kind of neural networks works particularly well with image data?
  answer: >
    <b>Convolutional neural networks</b> are a kind of neural network that works
    particularly well with image data.
    <br><br>
    The basic idea behind convolutional neural networks is to 
    divide the input image into small fragments and apply a number of filters on 
    each fragment. Applying a filter is equivalent to searching for a pattern in the fragment.
    Each filter has a specific task, like searching for edges or for circles. 
    <br><br>
    In this way convolutional neural networks can better deal with images that are not very similar,
    for example because the images are rotated differently.

- question: What kind of neural network is particulary good at processing text data?
  answer: >
    A kind neural network that is particulary good at processing text data is 
    <b>recurrent neural networks</b>.
    <br><br>
    A recurrent neural network has an intern loop, that means the data is not processed all at once 
    but rather is processed in different steps. In particular in the case of text, each word is 
    processed once at a time. This process is similar to the way humans read text.

- question: What is transfer learning? What are some typical use cases?
  answer: >
    <b>Transfer learning</b> is a technique in which a model, that was tried tried on a task,
    is applied to a different but related task. For example you have a model trained to
    recognize cars and you use that model to recognize trucks.
    <br><br>The obvious advantage of transfer learning is that you can reuse an existing model with
    minimal effort. 
    <br><br>Some typical use cases of transfer learning are
    <ul>
    <li>You do not have enough data to train a model from scratch. Starting with a pre-trained can allow you
    to train the model for your task.</li>
    <li>You do not have enough time to train a model from scratch. Because training models can take days or even
    weeks, using a pre-trained model is much more faster.</li>
    </ul>

-question: Implement a simple feedforward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. Train it on a dataset to perform image classification.
  
  answer:
    <p>Here's a basic example of a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification:</p>

    <pre><code>
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras

    # Load the dataset (e.g., MNIST)
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

    # Preprocess the data
    x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
    # Build the neural network model
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
    # Evaluate the model
    test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
    </code></pre>

    <p>This code demonstrates building a simple neural network for image classification on the MNIST dataset.</p>

-question: Explain the concept of transfer learning in deep learning. Provide a real-world example.**
  answer:
  <p>Transfer learning in deep learning is a technique where a pre-trained neural network, typically on a large dataset, is used as a starting point to solve a different but related problem. The idea is to leverage the knowledge gained during training on the initial task and adapt it to the new task, often with less training data and computation.</p>
  <p>For example, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that has learned to recognize a wide range of 
  objects in images can be fine-tuned for a specific image classification task, like classifying different species of flowers.
  The pre-trained model already possesses features that are generally useful for recognizing edges, shapes, and textures, making it easier to adapt to the new task with a smaller dataset.</p>

-question: What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning, and how can it be mitigated?**
  answer:
   <p>The vanishing gradient problem is a challenge in training deep neural networks, particularly in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep feedforward networks. It occurs when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, causing the network's weights to update very slowly or not at all. This can lead to slow convergence and difficulty in training deep models.</p>

  <p>To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, several techniques can be used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Replace activation functions like sigmoid with alternatives such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which are less prone to vanishing gradients.</li>
    <li><strong>Weight Initialization:</strong> Use appropriate weight initialization techniques like Xavier/Glorot initialization to ensure that weights have reasonable initial values.</li>
    <li><strong>Batch Normalization:</strong> Apply batch normalization to normalize the inputs at each layer, helping gradients to flow more smoothly.</li>
    <li><strong>Gated Architectures:</strong> Architectures like LSTMs and GRUs use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, reducing the vanishing gradient problem in sequential data models.</li>
    <li><strong>Gradient Clipping:</strong> Clip gradients during training to prevent them from becoming excessively large or small.</li>
  </ul>
