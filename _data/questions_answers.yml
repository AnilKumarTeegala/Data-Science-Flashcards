  answer: >
    Data science = statistical analysis + data engineering in order to get 
    information from the data
    <br><br>
    Machine learning = create a model to predict something. You can also define

    Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible outcomes
    Continuous random variables you cannot count the number of possible outcomes

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A?
  answer: num cases for event A / num all cases

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: A’ is the event that A does not happen and is given by 1-P(A)
