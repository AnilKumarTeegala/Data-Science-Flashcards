  question: What is the difference between data science and machine learning
  answer: >
    Data science = statistical analysis + data engineering in order to get 
    information from the data
    <br><br>
    Machine learning = create a model to predict something. You can also define 
    it as teaching computers to learn by examples

- question: What is a random variable?
  answer: > 
    It assign a numerical value to each possile outcome. A numeric value is a necessary condition in 
    the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. 
    Remember that values of random variables are determined by chance.

- question: Can you explain the two types of random variable discrete and continuous?
  answer: >
    Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible outcomes
    Continuous random variables you cannot count the number of possible outcomes

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A?
  answer: num cases for event A / num all cases

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: A’ is the event that A does not happen and is given by 1-P(A)

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    It means that only one of them can occur

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously

- question: What is the probability P(A or B)?
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

- question: > 
    If  events A  and B are disjoint, what is the probability of either event 
    (A or B)
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

- question: What does it mean that 2 events are independent?
  answer: >
    These are 2 events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br>
    P(A|B) = P(A)
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both 
    events is the product of the probabilities for each event?
  answer: P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

- question: What is the law of total probability?
  answer: > 
    P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A’) = 
    <br>
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)

  question: What is the hamming distance?
  answer: >
    The hamming distance is used for categorical features. If all the variables 
    are categorical then the hamming distance is defined as the number of mismatches
