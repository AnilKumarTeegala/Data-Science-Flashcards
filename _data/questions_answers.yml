  question: What is the difference between data science and machine learning
  answer: >
    Data science = statistical analysis + data engineering in order to get 
    information from the data
    <br><br>
    Machine learning = create a model to predict something. You can also define 
    it as teaching computers to learn by examples

- question: What is a random variable?
  answer: > 
    It assign a numerical value to each possile outcome. A numeric value is a necessary condition in 
    the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. 
    Remember that values of random variables are determined by chance.

- question: Can you explain the two types of random variable discrete and continuous?
  answer: >
    Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible 
    outcomes
    <br><br>
    Continuous random variables you cannot count the number of possible outcomes

- question: What is a probability distribution?
  answer: A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

- question: What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A?
  answer: num cases for event A / num all cases

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: A’ is the event that A does not happen and is given by 1-P(A)

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    It means that only one of them can occur

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously

- question: What is the probability P(A or B)?
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

- question: > 
    If  events A  and B are disjoint, what is the probability of either event 
    (A or B)
  answer: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

- question: What does it mean that 2 events are independent?
  answer: >
    These are 2 events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br>
    P(A|B) = P(A)
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both events happen?
  answer: P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

- question: What is the law of total probability?
  answer: > 
    P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A’) = 
    <br>
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)
- question: Make the plot of an uniform distribution

- question: What types of discrete probability distributions are there?
  answer: >
     There are the Bernoulli distribution, the Binomial distribution and
     the Poisson distribution.
     <br><br>
     The Bernoulli distribution is a random experiment that has 2 possible
     outcomes with probability p and q, where p+q = 1
     <br><br>
     The Binomial distribution is a sequence of repeated Bernoulli trials
     performed indipendently. 
     <br>
     n = number of items, k = num items I pickup
     <br> All possible combinations are n! / ( (n-k)! * k! )
     <br><br>
     The Poisson distribution is a limiting version of the Binomial distribution
     where the number of trials n gets really large but the probability of success p
     gets smaller at the same time. In other words if you have a Binomial distribution
     where you let n tends to infinite and p tends to zero such that np = &lambda;, then
     that distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter &lambda;.

  question: What is the hamming distance?
  answer: >
    The hamming distance is used for categorical features. If all the variables 
    are categorical then the hamming distance is defined as the number of mismatches

- question: What is the Manhattan (or city block) distance?
  answer: >
    It is the number of horizontal and/or vertical steps to go from point p1 to point 
    p2

- question: What is the distance matrix?
  answer: >
    It is a square matrix (two-dimensional array) containing the distances, taken 
    pairwise, between the elements of a set of points

- question: What is the Levenshtein distance?
  answer: >
    The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits 
    (insertions, deletions or substitutions) to change one word into one another

- question: What is the Z-score normalization (also called standardization)?
  answer: > 
    It is a technique that scales the values so that they will have the properties
    of a standard distribution with mean &mu; = 0  and standard deviation &sigma; = 1.


- question: What is the min-max scaling (also called normalization)?
  answer: It is a technique that scales the values between 0 and 1.

- question: When is Z-score normalization used? When is min-max scaling used instead?
  answer: >
    The min-max scaling can work better when the distribution is not gaussian
    or when the standard deviation is very small.

- question: >
    What is the disadvantage of min-max scaling compared to Z-score normalization 
    concerning outliers?
  answer: >
    The min-max scaling is more sensitive to min-max scaling since the data is
    bounded between 0 and 1 which automatically leads to information loss about
    outliers. 
    <br>
    The Z-score normalization is more suited when there are outliers since the
    data is not bounded but simply rescaled to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

- question: How to treat missing values?
  answer: >
    There are several possible approaches<br>
    a) remove items with missing values<br>
    b) replace the missing value

- question: When is it reasonably possible to drop items with missing values?
  answer: When the items to remove are few compared to the size of the training set 

- question: What are the common techniques for replacing missing values?
  answer: >
    when values are missing randomly you can:<br>
    a) replace the missing values with the mean<br>
    b) interpolate values<br>
    c) take the previous or next value
- question: Can you draw a boxplot and explain it?
  answer: >
    Upper extreme (95th Percentile) = exactly 5 percent of the values in the data are 
    greater than this value. (May instead be the highest value if not displayed separately as dots).<br>
    Lower extreme (5th Percentile) = exactly 5 percent of the values in the data are less than this value. 
    (May instead be the smallest value if not displayed separately as dots).

- question:  What is a bar chart? What is the difference with an histogram?
  answer: >
    A bar chart records the frequency of every value of a categorical variable. It 
    is the same as an histogram except the histogram is for a continuous variable
- question: How to find outliers?
  answer: >
    You can use an histogram, a scatter plot or also some statistics values like to say that 
    outliers are outside of the 1.5 IQR limit

  question: What is Naive Bayes?
  answer: >
    Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes theorem that is used
    to solve classification problems.

- question: Why is Naive Bayes called "naive"?
  answer: >
    Because the Naive Bayes is based on the idea that the predictor variables are independent of 
    each other while in nature this is oft not the case.
- question: When is the Naive Bayes usually used
  answer: > 
    Naive Bayes is often used in <br>
    - text classification like spam filter<br>
    - real-time classification since it is fast<br>
    - multi-class prediction

- question: When Naive Bayes is used with numerical variables, what condition is assumed on the data?
  answer: >
    Numerical variables used in Naive Bayes are expected to have a normal distribution.
    This is not always the case in practice.

- question: How does the Naive Bayes perform with categorical variables?
  answer: > 
    It performs well with categorical variables since no assumpion is made on
    the data distribution. By contrast with numerical variables a normal distribution
    is assumed.
