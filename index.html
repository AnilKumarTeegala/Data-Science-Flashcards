		<div>
			<div>What is Difference between data science and machine learning</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
				<p>Data science = statistical analysis + data engineering in order to get information from the data</p>
				
				Machine learning = create a model to predict something. You can also define it as teaching computers to learn by examples
			</div>
		</div>

			<div class="divQuestion">What is a random variable?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
				It assign a numerical value to each possible outcome. A numeric value is a necessary condition in the sense that something not numeric chosen at random is NOT a random variable. Remember that values of random variables are determined by chance
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div class="divQuestion">Can you explain the two types of random variable discrete and continuous?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
				Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible outcomes
				Continuous random variables you cannot count the number of possible outcomes
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div class="divQuestion">What is a probability distribution?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
				A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes.

		<h3>Machine learning</h3>
		
		<div>
			<div class="divQuestion">How does machine learning differ from data mining?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
				Machine learning aims at predictions based on known properties learned from the  training data. 
				Data mining focuses on discovery of unknown properties on the data
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div class="divQuestion">How to prevent overfitting?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
					Overfitting happens when your model that trais your training data too well and cannot generalize.
					To prevent overfitting you can use regularization and cross-validation.
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div class="divQuestion">What is cross-validation in machine learning?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >
						Cross-validation refers to the process of splitting a dataset into a training set (usually 80) and test
				    set (usually 20%). This splitting is done randomly. This is usually repeated 10 times.
			</div>

			<div class="divQuestion">What is regularization in machine learning?</div>
			<button onclick="showHideAnswer()">Answer</button>
			<div class="divAnswer" >	
					Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting. 
					Regularization adds a penalty on the different parameters of the model to reduce the freedom of the model
					Regularization is usually done by adding a correction term to the formula for a mathematical model. 
					This correction term penalizes the higher order terms so that the model is forced to be simpler.
